Introduction to CMD 
The way we interact with a computer on a day to day basis is through the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
But that wasn't always the case.  And in many ways it is still easier to the terminal.  Today we are
going to introduce just a couple of commands that are useful in everday use.

first open the Command Prompt (Terminal in Linux) by pressing windows+r, typing cmd, and press return.

From here you can navigate the file structure of your machine.  Create and exectue files, and run your
whole computer.  for example type "start chrome.exe yahoo.com"

The first command we will learn is 'dir'  This is on windows.  On Linux systems it is 'ls'
dir will list out and show you all of the files and directories in the current working directory.

Speaking of current working director.  lets go ahead and change the one we are in.  If you look at 
the list of directories shown on your screen you should see the 'Doucuments' folder listed.  lets jump 
into that one.

The command is 'cd <path to the directory>  So for us it would be 'cd Documents'.  Notice how the text before
your curser has changed.  it went from C:\Users\username> to C:\Users\username\Documents>.  Now we can use the dir
command again to see what is in this directory.

Now lets make a new directory.  The 'mkdir <filename>  will make a new folder with 'filename' in yoru current 
working directory.  Lets try it out.  Make a directory called itech190-test.  (mkdir itech190-test) Once
you have run the mkdir command, run the dir command again to see your new directory.

Now lets cd into our itech190-test directory

once we are here, lets make a new txt document.  First lets use the dir command to show that our directory is 
currently empty.  Now let's use the 'echo' command to create a new file.  Normally echo will just display whatever
you want to the screen.  For example type the command 'echo test.txt'.  Notice that test.txt is displayed to the 
screen.  But if you run the dir command again, your directory is still empty.

However, if we use the '>' key with echo we can create a new file.  Enter the comane 'echo > test.txt'.  Now this 
time there is no output but if you run the dir comand again you will see that there is now a file in your directory 
called test.txt!

lets get rid of that.  It was just a test document anyways right?  'del <filename>' is the command we will use to 
delete this file.  go ahead and delete it 'del test.txt'

But what if I actually wanted to open that file and write stuff to it?  lets do that now!

First, lets create a new text file called todo.  'echo > todo.txt' and then to open it we have to tell the computer 
which program to use to open it.  In our case notepad will work.  the command is 'notepad todo.txt'  This will open
out todo.txt file in a notepad.  How exciting!   

Alright.  Lets go ahead and get out of here.  close the notepad.  The commane is alt-F4.  Note this is a windows
shortcut.  Not a cmd specific one.  So it will close down ANY app/program you are currently in.  So make sure that
the app you want to close is currently active.  go ahead and alt-F4 the notpad and your curser will go to the most
recent app you used before the one you just closed.

lets delete the todo file with 'del todo.txt'

Now lets go back the the documents directory.  Currently we are in C:\Users\username\Documents\itech190-test.  To get 
back to the Documents directory the command is 'cd ../'.  This is the same cd command as before,  except the '../'  
tells the computer we want to go back up a level.

Now that we are in the Documents directory lets go ahead and delete the itech190-test directory we made.  At first 
you may think that you can use the same 'del' command that we did earlier to delete a file.  however that will only 
delete the files in the itech190-test directory.  But the directory will still remain.

To delete the directory we want to use the 'rmdir' command.  Go ahead and try that now.  If you had any subfolders
or documents in your directory, that command failed.  it gave you an error 'The directory is not empty'.  This is 
a safety feature.  In order to force it to delete the directory and ALL of the content in the directory, we will 
add in the /s command.  so now the cammand is 'rmdir /s itech190-test'

go ahead and run this command now.  followed by the 'dir' command in order to confirm you have deleted the whole directory

One last bit of clean up.  You currently have A LOT of text on your screen.  All of the commands, all of the directories
printed out multiple times.  lets clear the screen.  the command for this is 'cls'.  And boom!  you are back to a bank 
screen.

You just learned how to:
1) open command Prompt
2) navigate your file tree using the 'cd' command
3) make and remove directories
4) make, open, and remove files
5) clear your screen.

When you are working in the IT / Software development space.  This is a workflow you will do all the time. It is 
good to get used to using the terminal in addition to your normal GUI.

That said lets get started on the next section.
1) cd into C:\users\username
2) create a new directory called itech190
3) cd into itech190
4) open that directory with the command 'code .' - code is the command for openening VsCode and . tells the computer 
you want to open the directory you are currently in.

Introduction to GIT 
In this part of today's lab, we are going to:
1) create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. 
2) create a repository
3) learn how to clone a repository 
4) make our first commits and pushes.
