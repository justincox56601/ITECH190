This class aims to do 2 things. 1) Teach students how to think / problem solve as copmuter scientists, and
2) how to use the Python programming language.  To accomplish this

github instructions:
1) clone the repo:  git clone <address to repo>
2) make your own repo on your git hub account
3) get the https link to your repo
4) open a terminal and make sure you are in the directory of your project
